Now the first line that we're going to add is nice and easy. We’re going to use fetch and we're going to call it
with the same URL that we used before which is the basic API URL. Don't forget the trailing slash.

Then things get a little bit different, we’re going to use this method called 'then', which we chain onto the end.

And that's going to get our response, convert it to text and store it in this variable called response using our arrow function.

After that, we're going to chain on a second 'then' method. And this is going to use a function that we know very, very well
our familiar way of setting text on the DOM.

So that's my 'document.getElementById', we're going to set the inner text of our content div to the data that we returned.

So now that that's all in place when we save the file and preview it, -->
